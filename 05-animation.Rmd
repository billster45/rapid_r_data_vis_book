# Animation

## ggplot animation

* Animation is quick to add to ggplot using the gganimate package. I've had a play [here](https://github.com/billster45/gganimate-experiments/blob/master/README.md) inspired by a good Tweet of examples.

* I've found animation is usually most effective at showing changes over time. Here is the annual pattern of house sales changing each year.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("housing.gif") 
```

```{r animate_housing,eval= FALSE}

# for each city and year find the sales value in the latest month availalbe 
# usually this is 12 but sometimes it's an earlier month

## plotly animation

* Carson Sievert's book shows us how to [animate in plotly](https://plotly-r.com/animating-views.html).

* The code to animate a plotly plot is easier than for ggplot. Simply specify which column to animate over in the frame argument of plotly::add_lines().

```{r}
df_red %>% 
  plotly::plot_ly(alpha  = 1) %>%
  plotly::add_lines(
    x = ~month, 
    y = ~sales,
    frame = ~year,  # this single line of code turns it into an animation!
    color = ~factor(city),
    line = list(simplify = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  plotly::layout(yaxis = list(title = "Sales"))
```

* Here we play around with the animation style.

```{r}
df_red %>% 
  plotly::plot_ly(alpha  = 1) %>%
  plotly::add_lines(
    x = ~month, 
    y = ~sales,
    frame = ~year, 
    color = ~factor(city),
    line = list(simplify = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  plotly::layout(yaxis = list(title = "Sales")) %>% 
  plotly::animation_opts(frame = 1000, 
                       #  easing = "elastic", 
                         easing = "bounce", 
                         redraw = FALSE) %>%
  plotly::animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "YEAR ", 
                                               font = list(color="blue")))
```
