# Why read this?

## The best data analysis starts with fast & intuitive EDA

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the foundation of most data work from data engineering to [Kaggle Data Science competition winners](http://blog.kaggle.com/category/winners-interviews/).

* Ideally you will explore your data **quickly** and intuitively in a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) absorbed by the patterns and stories your data reveals, not slowed by code errors and Google searches. 

* This book aims to help you explore data faster with fewer errors. And at the same time, not compromise on code clarity and quality so it is is easy to read and re-use. It shows you a series of linked methods in a logical order to explore and visualise data quickly before you commit to the intense process of polishing your final chosen plot. 

* All the examples are aimed at beginners in R to those with an intermediate level of skill. Experienced R users might also pick up a new trick. And anyone could suggest an improvement or adddition in the issues here

* Each section starts with simple code so it you can be used as a tool for fast Exploratory Data Analysis. Then a more complex version is provided you can adapt to turn it into publicatoin quality plots.

* This book is my *current* approach to data visualiation in R. But my methods keep changing and improving from reading [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd&lang=en) daily, and learning from colleague's work.

* I've underlined the Visualise and Communicate parts of the Data Science workflow diagram below from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#what-you-will-learn) that this book covers. And added code communication to emphasise the importance of well laid out code as another key part of communicating both to your future yourself and anyone reading or re-using your code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```

## What about Python for data viz?

* Python is great for data visualisation too through Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Bokeh. My day to day work only allows R so this is where I've built my code based data vis skills so far. A good place to find similar examples to this book are Python Notebooks on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels). Use the filters at the top to select popular data visulisation notebooks in Python. 

## What about Point and Click EDA tools? 

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Point and Click (PaC) tools like Excel, PowerBI and Tableau still have their place as long as we recognise their strengths and weaknesses. Hadley Wickham contrasts PaC tools vs code tools well in this [interview](http://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/).

>**Point-and-click interfaces are great, because they lay out all of your options in front of you, and you don’t have to remember anything. You can navigate through the set of pre-supplied options. And that’s also it’s greatest weakness, because first of all, you are constrained into what the developer thought you should be able to do.** And secondly, because your primary interaction is with a mouse, it’s very **difficult to record what you did. And I think that’s a problem for science, because ideally you want to say how you actually got these results. And then simply do that reliably and have other people critique you on that.** But it’s also really hard when you are learning, because when you have a problem, how do you communicate that problem to someone else? You basically have to say, “I clicked here, then I clicked here, then I clicked here, and I did this.” Or you make a screen cast, and it’s just clunky. 

>So, the advantages of programming languages like **R or Python, is that the primary mechanism for communicating with the computer is text. And that is scary because there’s nothing like this blinking cursory in front of you; it doesn’t tell you what to do next. But it means you are unconstrained, because you can do anything you can imagine.** And you have all these advantages of text, where if you have a problem with your code, you can copy and paste it into an email, you can Google it, you can check it and put it on GitHub, or you can share it by Twitter. **There’s just so many advantages to the fact that the primary way you relate with a programming language is through code, which is just text. And so, as long as you are doing data analysis fairly regularly, I think all the advantages outweigh a point and click interface** like Stata.

## Find an R master to inspire you

### David Robinson

* How David Robinson explores, cleans then analystes data in R inspires me. Several methods in this book I saw Robinson use on his Tidy Tuesday live coding YouTube videos. I'd strongly reccomend watching any of his live coding videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+robinson+tidy+tuesday). This book is about the exploratory visuatoins and communicaition part of Data Science, but Robinson goes through the complete R for Data Sciecne workflow path shown above from import to communicate, and all in one hour (or less if you speed up his videos).

### Claus Wilke

* Another R master, Claus Wilke has created a new guide similar to this book. It starts with simple examples that become more complex. In his [Practical ggplot2](https://github.com/wilkelab/practicalgg) guide see how he starts with the bare minimum code you need to create the plot then gradually builds it up into something that is publication quality. 

* He wrote it to help you more easily make charts like those in the [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/). This book is similar to Wilke's but with a greater focus on exploratory data analysis. I also offer a wider set of tools beyond ggplot (particulary for interactive plots, as well as a clean code style.
