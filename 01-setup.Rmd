## Navigating an R markdown 

* A quick way to move around an R Markdown document in RStudio is through the document outline. You can see the outline by holding down Ctrl+Shift+O, clicking the top right icon in the code pane, or left clicking on the bottom bar of the R markdown file. The gif below shows you how it works.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("outline.gif") 
```

## The data to visualise

* A lot of data visilisation shows values changing over time. For this reason, instead of using a [built in data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) like iris or mtcars this guide uses a built-in data set within ggplot. It is the [txhousing](http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ggplot2/txhousing.html) data set built into ggplot. It provides house sales in American cities over several years. 

* If you're looking for a smalll well behaved data set to test your skills take a look at this [comprehensive list of R datasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/).

* The only manipulation we will do on the txhousing data set is create a real date using [lubrdate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/). We also create a smaller data frame with a smaller number of American cities so some of the plots aren't too crowded.

* We'll alo use [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog/blob/master/README.md) with dplyr. It's a simple way to do fast basic Quality Asssurance as you code. Simply replace dplyr verbs with the same verb in tidylog. This will tell you what each dplyr verb has done to your data. For example, how many rows are dropped or added by filters or joins, or what percentage of values changed after a mutate.

```{r create_df, message=TRUE}
# create a data frame with a real date for plotting
df <- ggplot2::txhousing %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year,
                                              month = month, 
                                              day =1)) 
```

* Let's also create a data frame with fewer cities. This will make plots less crowded later. Here we select only cities where the maximum number in any month is 800 or more.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 500)
```

* But look! Read the messages above created by tiylog. It tells us what percentage of values are NA. The mutate must have gone wrong as it tells us there are 43% NA. Well spotted tidylog. We correct it below by removing NAs from the maximum sales value.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales, 
                                        na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 500)
```

* This has worked with 0% NA in the tidlog message above.

* Let's now look at the top few rows of the data frame using kableExtra table. A later chapter explores tables.

```{r}
kableExtra::kable(utils::head(df))
```

## Code style 

### Include the package name every time. Why?

* When I first started learning R I tried to teach myself using other people's code. I got confused where functions came from, particularly when they mixed functions from many packages, base functions and their own functions. It made their code appear harder, more complex and cleverer than it really was.

* Instead I use the package name before every function. Even base R functions. This can help people new to R who read your code. And you can help you future self when you come back to code you did ages ago and have forgotten what you were doing. 

* Another good reason to use the package name is being able to hit the tab key at the end of the double colon like this and see all the functions in that package.

* Also, try highlighting a function and its package name and hit the F1 key. (You'll see David Robinson do this a lot even on his own packages.) Also try hitting the F2 key to quickly see all the possible parameters in a function and see what the defaults are that it will use if you don't set them to a new value. 

```{r package_name, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::
dplyr::arrange()
ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "1100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("package_name.gif") 
```

### One line does one thing - hit the return key a lot

* Ideally one line does one thing. Hit the return key after every pipe, comma or plus symbol in ggplot and RStudio tabs your code in the right way. 

* Also, name the parameters in each function instead of relying on theorder the function expects them. Your code is then easier to read by others and you later.

* For example, below this works but doesn't follow any of those rules. The code is cramped and slow to understand, edit or re-use.

```{r cramped_code, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(date, sales, colour = city)) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight(max(sales) > 5000, label_params = list(size = 4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", labels = scales::date_format("%d %b %y"), limits = c(as.Date("2000-01-01"), as.Date("2015-07-01"))) +
  labs(title = "US Housing Sales over time", subtitle = "US cities with more than 5k sales in a month", caption = "Source: ggplot2 package demo data") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = years, linetype = 4) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 9), legend.text = element_text(size = 12), legend.position = "right", legend.direction = "vertical", plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey", size = 18), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 12, color = "darkgrey"), legend.title = element_blank())
```

* In oontrast, the code below is the same code as above but it follows these 5 rules:

1. Include package names before each function. Even for [base functions](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html).
2. Each line does one thing (e.g. a function or the value of one argument in a function).
3. Name every argument you set the value of in a function.
4. Tabbed consistently by hitting the return key after each pipe ( %>% ), comma or plus symbol (+).
5. Put spaces around equals.
6. Use [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) to automatically apply some of these rules. 

The benefits of following these rules are that you can:

1. Run your code top downwards in chunks adding more lines each time (like the popular ggplot flipbooks I describe at bullet 11 in my collection of [R guides and galleries](https://github.com/billster45/r-guides-and-galleries/blob/master/README.md#learn-to-visualise-data-with-r)
2. Comment out whole lines of code or parameters in a function to undersatnd what they are doing.
3. Easily find and edit parameaters in a function (e.g. a font size)
4. Help others QA or re-use your code more quickly.
5. Help others new to R understand what you are doing and learn R faster.
6. You are not being a "gatekeeper" of your growing R knowledge and skills. Share, explain and democratise what you know. You can then move on to more complex analysis in R with an even higher value (as proposed by Richard Susskind in [The Future of Professions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198713398/)).

```{r clean_code, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(
    x = date,
    y = sales,
    colour = city
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(max(sales) > 5000,
                           label_params = list(size = 4)
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = "1 year",
    labels = scales::date_format("%d %b %y"),
    limits = c(
      as.Date("2000-01-01"),
      as.Date("2015-07-01")
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "US Housing Sales over time",
    subtitle = "US cities with more than 5k sales in a month",
    caption = "Source: ggplot2 package demo data"
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(
    xintercept = years,
    linetype = 4
  ) +
  ggplot2::theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      angle = 60,
      hjust = 1,
      size = 9
    ),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.direction = "vertical",
    plot.title = element_text(
      size = 22,
      face = "bold"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      color = "grey",
      size = 18
    ),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      hjust = 0,
      size = 12,
      color = "darkgrey"
    ),
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```

* Note this layout differs from the [layered gramar of graphics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-layered-grammar-of-graphics) code template below...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

* My preference is to mentally view this as data being poured into ggplot through the pipe, then we tell it which columns to map, then the geom, followed by the same co-ordinate and facet function as Wickham reccomends. 

* This is inspired by the code lay out of the many flipbook guides I describe at bullet 11 [here](https://github.com/billster45/r-guides-and-galleries#learn-to-visualise-data-with-r).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<DATA> %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::aes(<MAPPINGS>) +
  ggplot2::<GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```
