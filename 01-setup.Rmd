## Navigating an R markdown 

* A quick way to move around an R Markdown document in RStudio is through the document outline. You can see the outline by holding down Ctrl+Shift+O, clicking the top right icon in the code pane, or left clicking on the bottom bar of the R markdown file. The gif below shows you how it works.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("outline.gif") 
```

## The data to visualise

* A lot of data visilisation is showing how values change over time. Therefore, rather than the ususal iris or mtcars, this guide uses a built-in data set within ggplot of housing sales in American cities over several years.

* The only manipulation we will do is to create a real date using the excellet R lubrdate package. We also reduce the number of American cities so our first charts aren't too crowded.

* In this simple data preperation or wrangling I'll use tidylog with dplyr. It's a simple way to do fast basic Quality Asssurance as you code. 

* Simple replace dplyr verbs with the same verb in tidylog. This will tell you key info about what is being done to your data by each dplyr verb. For example, how many rows are dropped or added by filters or joins, and what percentage of values changed after a mutate.

```{r create_df, message=TRUE}
# create a data frame with a real date for plotting
df <- ggplot2::txhousing %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year,
                                              month = month, 
                                              day =1)) 
```

* Let's also create a data frame with fewer cities. This will make plots less crowded later. Here we select only cities where the maximum number in any month is 800 or more.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 800)
```

* But look! Look at these useful messages above created by tiylog. It tells us what percentage of values are NA. And how many rows the filter has removed. But the mutate has gone wrong as it tells us there are 43% NA. Well spotted tidylog. We correct it below by removing the NAs from the maximum sales value.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales, 
                                        na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 800)
```


* This has worked with 0% NA.

* Let's take a quick look at the top few rows of the data using kableExtra table. A later chapter explores tables.

```{r}
kableExtra::kable(utils::head(df))
```

## Code style 

### Include the package name every time. Why?

* When I first started learning R I tried to teach myself with other people's code. I got confused where functions came from, particularly when they used their own functions. It made their code appear harder, more complex and cleverer than it really was. 

* Instead I use the package name before every function. Even base R functions. This can help people new to R who read your code. And it can help you when yourself when you come back to code you did ages ago and have forgotten what you were doing. 

* Another good reason to use the package name is you can hit the tab key at the end of the double colon like this and see all the functions in that package.

* Also, try highlighting a function, including the package name and hit the F1 key. (You'll see David Robinson do this a lot even on his own packages.) Also try hitting the F2 key to quickly see all the possible parameters in a function and see what the defaults are that it will use if you don't set them to a new value. 

```{r package_name, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::
dplyr::arrange()
ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "1100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("package_name.gif") 
```

### One line does one thing - Hit the return key a lot

* Ideally one line does one thing. Hit the return key after every pipe, comma or plus symbol in ggplot and RStudio tabs your code in the right way. 

* Also, name the parameters in each function instead of relying on theorder the function expects them. Your code is then easier to read by others and you later.

* For example, below this works but doesn't follow any of those rules. The code is cramped and slow to understand, edit or re-use.

```{r cramped_code, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(date, sales, colour = city)) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight(max(sales) > 5000, label_params = list(size = 4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", labels = scales::date_format("%d %b %y"), limits = c(as.Date("2000-01-01"), as.Date("2015-07-01"))) +
  labs(title = "US Housing Sales over time", subtitle = "US cities with more than 5k sales in a month", caption = "Source: ggplot2 package demo data") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = years, linetype = 4) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 9), legend.text = element_text(size = 12), legend.position = "right", legend.direction = "vertical", plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey", size = 18), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 12, color = "darkgrey"), legend.title = element_blank())
```

* In oontrast, the code below is the same code as above but it follows these 5 rules:

1. Use package names.
2. Each line does one thing (e.g. a function or a parameter setting in a function).
3. Name every parameter you put in a function.
4. Tabbed consistently by hitting the return key after each pipe ( %>% ), comma or plus symbol (+).
5. Put spaces around equals.

The benefits of following these rules are that you can:

1. Run your code top downwards in chunks adding more lines each time (like the popular ggplot flipbooks I describe at bullet 11 here: https://github.com/billster45/r-guides-and-galleries/blob/master/README.md#learn-to-visualise-data-with-r)
2. Comment out whole lines of code or parameters in a function to undersatnd what they are doing.
3. Easily find and edit parameaters in a function (e.g. a font size)
4. Help others QA or re-use your code more quickly.
5. Help others new to R understand what you are doing and learn R faster.
