# Setup {#intro}

## Navigate R markdown quickly 

* Instead of scrolling up and down your R Markdown code looking for certain chunk, jump quickly to the right bit of code you want to edit in RStudio using the document outline. View the doc outline in one of three ways:

1. Hold down Ctrl+Shift+O. 
2. Click the top right icon in the code pane.
3. Left click on the bottom bar of the R markdown file. 

The gif below shows these three methods. It was recorded with [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/). I found it super easy to use and so gave a donation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("outline.gif") 
```

## Rstudio shortcuts

* Another tip to speed up coding in RStudio is to use shortcuts. Here is the full list of [RStudio shorcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts).

* I use Ctrl+Shift+M in Windows (Cmd+Shift+M in Mac) to insert a pipe (%>%) with spaces. This makes tidyverse coding fast.

* I also use Alt+- in Windows (Option+- in Mac) to create the assign operator (<-).

## The data to visualise

* A lot of data visualisation looks at values changing over time. For this reason, instead of using a [built in data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) like iris or mtcars we are going to mostly use the [Texas housing sales ](http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ggplot2/txhousing.html) time series data built into ggplot.

* You may want to find more open data sets to develop your data vis skills. If so, take a look at this carefully curated and [comprehensive list of R datasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/).

* The only manipulation we will do to the Texas housing sales data is create a real date using [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/). 

* We'll also use [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog/blob/master/README.md) with dplyr. Tidylog is an easy way to include fast basic Quality Assurance into your coding process. You just replace dplyr verbs with the same verb in tidylog. The tidylog version tells you what each dplyr verb has done to your data in terms of the number and percentage of changes. For example, how many rows are dropped or added by filters or joins, or what percentage of values changed after a mutate.

```{r create_df, message=TRUE}
# create a data frame with a real date for plotting
df <- ggplot2::txhousing %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year,
                                              month = month, 
                                              day =1)) 
```

* Let's also create a data frame with fewer cities to make some plots less crowded later. Here we select only cities where the maximum number in any month is 800 or more.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 500)
```

* Hold on. Look! Read the tidylog messages above. It tells us the percentage of values that are "NA". The mutate must have gone wrong as 43% are NA. Well spotted tidylog. We correct it below by removing NAs from the maximum sales value using **na.rm = TRUE**.

```{r}
# reduce the number of cities for simpler plots
df_red <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(city) %>% 
  tidylog::mutate(sales_max = base::max(sales, 
                                        na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  tidylog::filter(sales_max >= 500)
```

* We know the code above has been corrected as its tidylog message now tells us there are 0% that are NA.

* Let's also look at the top few rows of the data frame we created using a kableExtra table. The [Tables] chapter later on in this book describes different table methods in more detail.

```{r}
kableExtra::kable(utils::head(df))
```

## Code style 

### Include the package and parameter names

* To make your code more transparent use the package name before every function. Even base R functions. 

* When I started learning R using other people's code. I got confused where functions came from. Particularly when the functions came from many packages (including base functions) and even their own functions. It made their code appear more complex and intimidating than it should have.

* Another benefit of typing the package name first you can hit the tab key at the end of the double colon and browse all the functions in that package.

* Also, try highlighting a function and its package name then hit the F1 key to see the help pages for that function. While hitting the F2 key can be a quick way to see all the possible parameters in a function including default values. 

* Finally, name the arguments in each function instead of relying on the expected argument order. Your code will be quicker to understand when we know exactly what arguments are being set without reading the help page.

```{r package_name, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::

ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "1100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("package_name.gif") 
```

### One line does one thing - hit the return key a lot

* Ideally one line of code does one thing. Hit the return key after every pipe (%>%), comma, or plus (+) and RStudio tabs will space your code out in just the right way.

* For example, the code below works but doesn't follow the rules so far (package & argument names and one action per line). The code is cramped, slow to understand, and can be difficult edit or re-use.

```{r cramped_code, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(date, sales, colour = city)) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight(max(sales) > 5000, label_params = list(size = 4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", labels = scales::date_format("%d %b %y"), limits = c(as.Date("2000-01-01"), as.Date("2015-07-01"))) +
  labs(title = "US Housing Sales over time", subtitle = "US cities with more than 5k sales in a month", caption = "Source: ggplot2 package demo data") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = years, linetype = 4) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 9), legend.text = element_text(size = 12), legend.position = "right", legend.direction = "vertical", plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "grey", size = 18), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 12, color = "darkgrey"), legend.title = element_blank())
```

* In contrast, the code below is the identical to the code above but it follows these 5 rules:

1. Include package names before each function. Even for [base functions](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html).
2. Name every argument you set in a function.
3. Each line does one thing by hitting the return key after each pipe ( %>% ), comma or plus symbol (+).
4. Put spaces around equals.
5. Use [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) to automatically apply some of these rules. 

The benefits of following these rules are that you can more easily:

1. Run your code top downwards in chunks adding more lines each time (like the popular ggplot flip-books I describe at bullet 11 in my collection of [R guides and galleries](https://github.com/billster45/r-guides-and-galleries/blob/master/README.md#learn-to-visualise-data-with-r)
2. Comment out whole lines of code or parameters in a function to understand what they are doing.
3. Find and edit arguments in a function (e.g. a font size)
4. Help others QA or re-use your code more quickly.
5. Help others new to R understand what you are doing and learn faster.
6. Avoid being a "gatekeeper" of your R knowledge and skills. Share, explain and democratise what you know. You can then move on to more complex analysis in R with an even higher value (as proposed by Richard Susskind in [The Future of Professions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198713398/)).

```{r clean_code, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(
    x = date,
    y = sales,
    colour = city
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(max(sales) > 5000,
                           label_params = list(size = 4)
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = "1 year",
    labels = scales::date_format("%d %b %y"),
    limits = c(
      as.Date("2000-01-01"),
      as.Date("2015-07-01")
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "US Housing Sales over time",
    subtitle = "US cities with more than 5k sales in a month",
    caption = "Source: ggplot2 package demo data"
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(
    xintercept = years,
    linetype = 4
  ) +
  ggplot2::theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      angle = 60,
      hjust = 1,
      size = 9
    ),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.direction = "vertical",
    plot.title = element_text(
      size = 22,
      face = "bold"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      color = "grey",
      size = 18
    ),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      hjust = 0,
      size = 12,
      color = "darkgrey"
    ),
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```

* Note this layout differs from the [layered gramar of graphics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-layered-grammar-of-graphics) code template below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

* My preference is to mentally view this as data being poured into ggplot through the pipe, then we tell it which columns to map, then the geom, followed by the same co-ordinate and facet function as Wickham recommends. 

* This is inspired by the code layout of the many flipbook guides I describe at bullet 11 [here](https://github.com/billster45/r-guides-and-galleries/blob/master/README.md#learn-to-visualise-data-with-r).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<DATA> %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::aes(<MAPPINGS>) +
  ggplot2::<GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```
